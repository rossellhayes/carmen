**carmen** determines the location associated with IP addresses in R.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of **fracture** from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fracture) with: -->

<!-- ``` {r eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- install.packages("fracture") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version of **carmen** from [GitHub](https://github.com/rossellhayes/carmen) with:

``` {r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rossellhayes/carmen")
```

## Usage

**carmen** can locate a vector of IP addresses.

```{r}
crm_locate("130.191.166.222")
```

**carmen** can be used within `dplyr::mutate()`.

```{r}
tibble(
  id   = seq_len(100),
  name = generator::r_full_names(100),
  ip   = generator::r_ipv4_addresses(100)
) %>%
  mutate(crm_locate(ip))
```

## Advantages `r emo::ji("rocket")`

**carmen** is written using vectorized R code and C++ code with Rcpp.
This allows it to run much faster than alternatives like [ip2location](https://github.com/ip2location/ip2location-r).
